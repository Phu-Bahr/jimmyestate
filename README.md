# Jimmy Estates

Working off of Boston Last Call repo, Jimmy Estate is a personal CMS website. My end goal was to create an application that would give the user most of the control on the content in their site like other CMS websites but without the monthly cost.

To reach this goal, my objective was to practice coding and understanding logic in the front end and back. The app was started with Rails and adding React/Webpacker

**Jimmy Estate is using the following technology:**
React v16
Ruby on Rails v5.2.3
Ruby 2.6.5
PostgreSQL
Heroku

**For contact information and maps:**
Google Geocode API
Google Maps JavaScript API
Google recaptcha
Httparty
Gmail
Railâ€™s ActionMailer

**Admin access (no devise):**
Bcrypt
Rack-cors

**The fund stuff:**
Bootstrap 4
Fontawesome
React-Animations
React-Animate-on-scroll
Animate.css
Draft-js (for a more dynamic form template to produce blogging content)
React-draft-wysiwyg (instead of creating my own tool bar, used this for draft-js)
React-particles-js (clickable floaty things on main home page)
Styled-Components (wanted to learn)
Moment
Pry

**Future Features:**
Zillow / Real Estate API 
Google Analytics 
README for installation
